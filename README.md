Following from the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWuP5Yf5ILI&ab_channel=RyanJohn, created a basic web scraper to find URLs containing a specific keyword to understand how scraping works in Python

Web Spidering, also known as Web indexing is a method to index the context of websites by searching and browsing the World Wide Web. The purpose of web crawling is to provide up to date information in search results. 

The first Python file called Web_Spidering.py scrapes for all the URLs in the website inputted. The second Python file called Web_Spidering2.py scrapes for all the URLs containing the keyword inputted by the user.
